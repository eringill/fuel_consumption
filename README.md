#Project Title: Fuel Consumption

## Context:

In fact, Canada have one of the highest ratios of car ownership in the world, with close to one vehical for every two Canadians. Climate change, sustainability, energy and fuel consumption from transportation are all interrelated topics that are worth investigating.

## Project Statement
